Overall Design
==============

Attic is written to be a multi-threaded application in two respects:
1) the main flow of logic is organized as a concurrent pipeline, and
2) multiple file transfers are made to each target if possible, by
allocating jobs from a pool of worker threads.

The first case is done so that transfers can begin as soon as
possible, even before all of the files within a file set have been
determined.  The second case is fairly common among file
synchronization programs, and is simply a way to better saturate an
ample network connection between two machines.

The pipeline is constructed as follows:

Stage 1: Information gathering
------------------------------

Stage 2: State reconciliation
-----------------------------

Stage 3: Execution of changes
-----------------------------

Stage 4: Validation and reporting
---------------------------------
